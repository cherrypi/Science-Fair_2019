### Parent's Statement

I have guided Brian in the use of the R programming language to
analyze his data. Brian already knew a little bit of R, and was
already comfortable in a Linux shell. My guidance was in describing
the broad outline of the steps he should take to perform his analysis,
pointing him towards relevant documentation, and showing him examples
of _unrelated_ code.

To be open in this process our exchanges are documented as a
[series of issues][issues] in this code repository. You may look at
that link to see the overall scope of our interactions. Clicking on
any of the links will show the details of the interaction, for example
[#9 Dealing with dates][dateex]. Near the end of each conversation you
might see little hexadecimal links, like [706e7a4][comex] - these will
show the modifications Brian has made to his code or data to address
the issue. Brian's username is `cherrypi`, I am `VCF`.
